# ESL-account_manager
Account_manager is a console application, which will help admins to manage leagues, matches, teams and users' profiles. 

The most significant feature of this app, to my mind, is function "auto_admin", which automatically checks new protests and beeps, if a new one is created. 

Hope this app will make your work as an ESL admin easier and will allow you to manage your projects fast and simply.
